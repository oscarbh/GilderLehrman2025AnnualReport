						</div>
						<div class="col-12 col-sm-12">
							<p class="mb-0 half-col2">Studying American history deepens our understanding of who we are as a nation and our roles as individuals. It allows us to see how principles like liberty, equality, and justice have evolved—and how they continue to be tested and redefined. Understanding the ideals and events that shaped our nation, especially during the founding era, offers context, insight, and a foundation for meaningful conversation. <br/><br/>The Institute is the leading nonprofit and nonpartisan organization dedicated to improving the teaching and learning of American history through educational programs and resources. We serve K–12 teachers and students, honor scholars, and welcome and inform the general public. Knowing our shared story is essential for our future. By deepening our understanding of the founding era and the broader American narrative, we fortify the pillars of civic society and foster critical thinking for a lifetime. <br/><br/>In 2025, we dedicated ourselves to this mission by supporting educators, inspiring students, and bringing communities together to explore America’s past. This report shares the programs, partnerships, and results that brought history into classrooms across the country.</p>

								<h3 class="mb-0 mt-0"><i> A letter from</i></h3>
								<h2> President James G. Basker </h2>
								<p>Dear Friends,<br/><br/>Our Co-Founder Lewis E. Lehrman always reminds us that what makes us Americans is not defined by blood or place of birth, race or religion, but a shared belief in a set of ideals articulated in the Declaration of Independence and Constitution. </p>
							</div>
						</div> 
						<div class="col-sm-12"> 
							<p> Every year, four million students turn 18 and become part of the body politic, eligible to vote, armed with the knowledge and understanding of American history that they gained in school. </p> 
							<p>Today, that knowledge and understanding matters more than ever, which is why the Gilder Lehrman Institute is committed to American history and civics as the most important subjects in the K–12 educational system.</p>
							<p>Teachers are the lifeblood of that system. This past year, we served more than 25,000 teachers with professional development delivered by top historians and supported with document-based teaching materials. Our master’s degree program, co-sponsored with Gettysburg College, has 1,156 teachers enrolled, and it is now open to “aspiring teachers”— those contemplating a career change into education.</p>
							<p>Our student-facing programs are flourishing. The Hamilton Education Program celebrated its tenth year, reaching more than one million students in 2025. Plans are underway for the next ten years, with help from the Rockefeller Foundation and others. Supported by a grant from the Carnegie Corporation, our Citizenship Test program enlisted thousands of students in classroom discussions about what a citizen should know—including those lucky enough to be born here— and what questions they would add to the examination. Our online study guide for the AP exam in US History had more than 1.2 million users, and our new guide for the AP in African American Studies skyrocketed its visitorship. </p>
							<p>Anticipating the 250th anniversary of the Declaration in 2026, we have been preparing an array of resources and programs, all of which can be found on our website. They range from an Annotated Declaration, which glosses every word and digs deep into the text itself, to an innovative and engaging character quiz, “Which Founder Are You?,” that reveals which of the founders you most resemble. We also produced a panel exhibition on the Declaration’s global impact, Declaration 1776: The Big Bang of Modern Democracy, copies of which have already gone out to scores of schools across the country.</p>
							<p>As you read this annual report, I hope you will decide to join in our efforts—whether connecting us with schools and teachers in your community, participating in one of our events in person or online, or supporting our efforts financially. As our country takes stock of itself in its 250th year, we will all be aware—in the words of Lin-Manuel Miranda’s Alexander Hamilton—that “history has its eyes on you.”</p>

					</div>
					<div class="col-6 col-sm-12">
						<p> By exploring American history, students gain insight into the issues that shape their communities today. Our student programs make these connections tangible, offering engaging resources and opportunities that spark curiosity, build knowledge, and cultivate critical thinking skills. Our goal is simple yet powerful: to make history education free, inspiring, and accessible to learners everywhere</p>
						<p class="red-clr h3 pt-1"> AP STUDY GUIDES </p>
						<p>Launched in spring 2025, our AP African American Studies Guide is a free resource that provides students with easyto-use content exploring the full range of African American history. Linking important themes, primary sources, and key research, the guide helps students acquire the knowledge and context they need to excel on the AP exam and beyond.</p>
						<p>Schools across the country have adopted the guide, and educators in the field have recognized its high quality. The guide features more than 500 resources from GLI and other archives, including images and historical documents, scholarly essays, videos from Professor Henry Louis Gates Jr.’s Black History in Two Minutes series, and learning resources from Professor Edward L. Ayers’s Teaching American History/Bunk digital history project.</p>
						<p>The guide received more than 18,000 views from nearly 7,500 users in the first month after its launch. The goal is to reach 50,000 users by May 2026 and to sustain annual growth thereafter.</p>

						<p> Our AP US History Study Guide provides students with a clear and comprehensive understanding of America’s past. It focuses on key ideas and includes essential documents, helping students build the knowledge and thinking skills they need for the exam and for active citizenship. Last year, the guide received a fresh new look, though still rigorously organized around the nine historical periods covered in the APUSH exam. This year, we further enhanced the guide’s usefulness by adding practice questions based on real exam content. The guide had more than one million views in 2025.  </p>

					<p class="half-col2">The Gilder Lehrman Institute developed a student-friendly version of the US naturalization exam for K–12 learners. With customized versions for elementary, middle, and high school students, the test offers score reports and explanations in an engaging format. Since its debut, it has been viewed more than 450,000 times by students, teachers, and the general public.<br><br>These resources also provide valuable support for teachers in states where passing the US citizenship test is a requirement for high school graduation. More broadly, they help students develop a deeper understanding of civics— laying the foundation for the next generation of informed and engaged citizens.<br><br>To extend this impact, we partnered with Kahoot! to create interactive civics lessons. These games offer another accessible way to explore American history and government. More than 85,000 players have taken the test through our Kahoots in classrooms and at home.<br><br>In addition to the online resources, we hosted the Building Better Citizens Online Summit, which brought together 160 educators from 37 states to share strategies for strengthening civics and history education. Survey results underscored its impact: 98% of respondents stated that the summit was a good use of their time, and 94% reported that they would increase their use of Gilder Lehrman resources as a result. Teachers described the experience as “encouraging and inspiring,” “nonpartisan,” and “empowering”—especially for those working in small or rural schools.<br><br>We also celebrated the winners of the first Building Better Citizens: An Innovative Curriculum Contest. First place was awarded to Colin Richardson, a public high school teacher from North Carolina. Additional prize-winning educators from Arizona, California, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, New York, and Washington, DC, created lesson plans for grades 3–12, now available as a resource for teachers nationwide.<br><br>Students were also invited to participate in the 2025 Citizenship Challenge: Redesigning America’s Citizenship Test, which asked them to propose new questions for the naturalization exam through essays, podcasts, or videos. From more than 450 submissions, 10 winners were selected, each receiving a $500 award.</p>

In partnership with The Rockefeller Foundation and the producers of HAMILTON, the Gilder Lehrman Institute launched EduHam to provide Title I-eligible schools with unparalleled access to both the hit Broadway show and a curriculum that connects the founding era to their own lives.  </p>
					<p>Over the past decade, more than 210,000 students from New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, and 22 other cities have attended HAMILTON through EduHam.
					More than 15,500 teachers and one million students nationwide have participated in EduHam Online, which extends the program’s reach far beyond the theater. For many students, HAMILTON was their first professional theater experience—an event they described as “lifechanging” and sparked new interest in history, theater, and civic engagement.</p>
					<p> In classrooms, EduHam has inspired students to dig into primary sources and create original songs, poems, and </p>

Teachers report dramatic results: student knowledge of the founding era more than doubled, enthusiasm for learning soared, and civic engagement rose sharply. Students themselves say EduHam makes history “entertaining and easy,” helping them see the connections between past debates and the issues shaping our democracy today.</p>
					<p>This year, the program continued its tradition of excellence. Nearly 7,000 New York City students attended matinees at the Richard Rodgers Theatre, along with 2,000 students in Los Angeles. Additionally, HAMILTON reached 2,500 students in rural communities who had the opportunity to participate in a Q&A session with HAMILTON cast and creative team members. </p>
					<p>EduHam Online participation expanded by 94,000 students, with creative submissions to the competition and lottery increasing by 60 percent. From rap battles about the Federalists and Anti-Federalists to heartfelt monologues by middle schoolers, student performances reflect the enduring power of history told in their own voices.</p>
					<p>As EduHam celebrates its 10th anniversary, we honor the vision that made it possible and the millions of young people whose lives it has already touched. With continued support, the Hamilton Education Program will carry its unifying, hopeful, and inclusive message to the next generation—helping students rise to write their own chapter in America’s great unfinished story.</p>

					<small><i>Teachers participating in a Summer Professional Development</i></small><br/>
					<p>Over the summer, the Institute offered 24 distinct professional development opportunities, ranging from intensive in-person seminars at partner institutions to accessible online. In total, we received nearly 4,000 registrations and applications across summer professionaldevelopment programs offered in 2025. </p>
					<p>This year’s programming reflected both the breadth and depth of American history. </p>
					<p>At Princeton University, the Statesmanship in American History Seminar, created in partnership with the James Madison Program, explored questions of leadership, governance, and civic responsibility. </p>
				</div> 
				<div class="col-6 col-sm-12">  
					<p> Teachers learned directly from Allen C. Guelzo, the Thomas W. Smith Distinguished Research Scholar in the James Madison Program in American Ideals and Institutions at Princeton University. </p>
					<p> In Springfield, Illinois, the Reframing Lincoln Seminar at the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum examined how myths, memory, and shifting narratives have shaped our understanding of the sixteenth president. The seminar featured Jonathan W. White, professor of American studies at Christopher Newport University</p>
					<p>Teachers also studied the Great Depression, the New Deal, and World War II in a seminar at Marist University. The program included lectures by David Woolner, senior fellow and resident historian of the Roosevelt Institute and professor of history at Marist University. Participants explored theconnections between Franklin D. Roosevelt’s  New Deal policies and the global transformations of World War II, with special sessions at the FDR Library examining sources and museum exhibitions.</p>  
					<p>Alongside these thematic seminars, the Institute convened its Teacher Symposium, offering seven in-depth courses led by distinguished scholars and master teachers, and hosted 10 Teacher Seminars Online to ensure broad access for educators. The mix of in-person and online learning opportunities allowed teachers across the country—and beyond—to connect with leading historians and peers, exchange ideas, and return to their classrooms with renewed skills and insights.</p>
					<p>By bringing together thousands of educators from diverse schools and communities, the Institute’s summer 2025 programs advanced our ongoing goal: to strengthen history education nationwide by empowering teachers with knowledge, tools, and networks that enrich their practice and inspire their students.</p>

Workshops for both programs are held in person. Each workshop is led by an eminent scholar on the topic being studied, and two Gilder Lehrman master teachers lead pedagogical sessions (one for elementary and one for secondary educators).<br/><br/>Project EXCEL supports a cohort of approximately 150 K–12 teachers, librarians, and administrators from underserved districts in western Virginia. Participants were engaged through self-paced online courses, four professional workshops held at the Roanoke Education Center during the school year, and a weeklong summer seminar in Missoula, Montana, which covered Lewis and Clark and the American West. Each of these resources was offered as part of a comprehensive curriculum designed to enhance teaching quality and student achievement among underserved populations.<br/><br/> Project TRAILS includes a cohort of approximately 100 K–12 teachers from underserved school districts in Kentucky. Held at Midway University’s Starks Center, the program offered three immersive in-person seminars, each focused on a pivotal era of American history. TRAILS also included a Boston summer seminar covering Colonial America and the American Revolution. By combining scholarly expertise with classroom practice, TRAILS brought history to life while empowering educators to inspire their students with new content and methods.<br/><br/>Together, EXCEL and TRAILS advanced the Institute’s commitment to expanding access to high-quality professional development for educators working in communities with the greatest need. </p>

					<p class="half-col2">We continue our partnership with the National Cemetery Administration’s Veterans Legacy Program by offering free professional development sessions, lesson plans, and online exhibitions focused on the legacy of Vietnam Veterans.<br/><br/>The Institute has published a new teaching unit, “Vietnam Veterans: Legacies of Service, 1965–2012,” featuring scholarship by Prof. William Sturkey (University of Pennsylvania) and lesson plans created by a master teacher. The resources explore topics such as the draft, military service, postwar benefits, and the ongoing contributions of Veterans to their communities. This curriculum provides students with the tools to connect national history with local Veterans’ stories.<br/><br/>The professional development programs surpassed expectations, reaching more than 338 teachers through spring workshops held in collaboration with national cemeteries. <br/><br/>Additionally, we engaged 69 educators through two four-day summer seminars, with hundreds more participating online. These sessions combined scholarly lectures, site-based learning at the National Museum of the Marine Corps and the LBJ Presidential Library and Museum, and pedagogy workshops, ensuring that educators left with both in-depth historical knowledge and practical classroom strategies.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the Legacies of Service Award student contest received 139 submissions—nearly triple our goal. This contest honored Veterans and service members interred in national and state cemeteries. Ten winners were selected to win $500 for their thoughtful research and creativity, showcasing projects that ranged from written work to podcasts to documentaries. Collectively, these initiatives engaged thousands of teachers and students in preserving and sharing the stories of Vietnam Veterans, ensuring that future generations will remember their service and sacrifices. </p>
